# UI design: the Silo look

Granary looks like Silo's web client, not like a stock Windows app (decided 2026-10-24). The values
below were read from the web client of a Silo server. Light mode is not offered: Silo itself is dark.
Window chrome stays Windows: caption buttons, keyboard and focus behaviour, accessibility.

## Tokens (`src/Granary.App/Themes/Silo.xaml`)

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `SiloBackgroundBrush` | `#141417` | Window, pages, sidebar |
| `SiloSurfaceBrush` | `#1C1C20` | Card and artwork placeholders, inputs |
| `SiloSurfaceRaisedBrush` | `#232328` | Hover and selected surfaces |
| `SiloBorderBrush` | `#2A2A2F` at 70 % | Dividers, outlines |
| `SiloForegroundBrush` | `#E8E8EC` | Text |
| `SiloMutedBrush` | `#A4A4AE` | Secondary text, overlines, section labels |
| `SiloPrimaryBrush` | `#EF4444` | The only accent: Play, progress, selection, focus |
| `SiloBadgeBackgroundBrush` / `SiloBadgeBorderBrush` | `#14141E` at 70 % / white at 15 % | Pills on artwork |
| `SiloCardCornerRadius` | 16 | Cards, artwork, sidebar items |
| `SiloPillCornerRadius` | 999 | Badges, chips, buttons |

The Fluent theme brushes (accent, text fills, page and navigation backgrounds) point at these values,
so stock controls fit without per-page styling.

Typeface: Plus Jakarta Sans (SIL OFL 1.1), one file per weight in `Assets/Fonts`. XAML only loads the
face of the file it names, so use the `SiloFont<Weight>` resources together with the matching
`FontWeight`; never fake a weight on the regular face.

| Style | Font | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `SiloDisplayTextStyle` | 56 / ExtraBold / tight | Title fallback on detail pages (when there is no logo), "Results for …" |
| `SiloPageTitleTextStyle` | 32 / Bold | Page titles |
| `SiloRowTitleTextStyle` | 20 / SemiBold | Row titles ("Continue Watching") |
| `SiloBodyTextStyle` | 15 / Regular, line height 26 | Overviews |
| `SiloCardTitleTextStyle` | 14 / SemiBold, one line | Card titles |
| `SiloOverlineTextStyle` | 11 / Medium, spaced, muted | Card subtitles ("2021 · SERIES"); text arrives upper-cased |
| `SiloSectionLabelTextStyle` | 11 / SemiBold, wide spacing, muted | "LIBRARIES", "EXPLORE ALL", breadcrumbs |
| `SiloCaptionTextStyle` | 12 / Medium, muted | Third lines, meta text |
| `SiloBadgeTextStyle` | 10 / SemiBold, white | Badge text |

Buttons: `SiloPrimaryButtonStyle` (red pill: Play, Resume), `SiloSecondaryButtonStyle` (dark pill:
Mark watched), `SiloIconButtonStyle` (round: favourite, more), `SiloLinkButtonStyle` ("EXPLORE ALL").
Chips: `SiloChipStyle` (year, rating, runtime), `SiloAccentChipStyle` (1080P, EAC3).

## Components (`src/Granary.App/Controls`)

- `MediaCardView` draws one `MediaCard` (`Granary.Core.ViewModels.Cards`): 2:3 poster or 16:9
  landscape artwork with radius 16, resolution badge top left, audio and status badges top right,
  rating bottom left, a watched mark bottom right, a 3 px red progress bar, then title, subtitle and an
  optional caption. Without artwork, or when it fails (expired signature), the title stands in.
- `MediaRow`: row title, optional "EXPLORE ALL", horizontally scrolling cards (posters 185 px,
  landscape 314 px, 20 px apart), arrows for mouse users.
- `MediaGrid`: cards filling the width (posters at least 185 px, landscape at least 280 px), meant to sit
  in the page's own `ScrollViewer`; `LoadMoreCommand` runs near the end for cursor paging.
- Cards are buttons (`SiloCardButtonStyle`): Tab and Enter work, screen readers read
  `MediaCard.AccessibleName`. Card commands take the `MediaCard` as parameter.

View models build `MediaCard`s with the texts already worded; the controls only lay them out.

## Layout

- Sidebar (260 px): server name, Home, Search (`Ctrl+K`), "LIBRARIES" with the server's libraries;
  Servers and the profile menu at the bottom. Detail pages shrink it to icons.
- Pages: 48 px side margins, 32 px top; rows 40 px apart.
- Detail pages: full-bleed backdrop fading into the background, logo (or display title), chips,
  ratings, overview with "More", red Play/Resume pill, secondary actions, then rows (seasons, episodes,
  cast, more like this).
- Back: the navigation view's back arrow, `Alt+Left`, and the mouse back button.

## Accounts and permissions

The web client was inspected with an admin account, which shows more (file paths under "Media
locations", the Admin area). Granary renders what the API returns for the signed-in account and hides a
section when its data is absent; nothing is shown because an account is assumed to be an admin.
